## A little bit about me

Mechanical engineer by training and more than 10 years of experience in the field of energy efficiency of buildings combined with a strong focus on energy modeling and interest in data science and machine learning applications.

I started my journey in 2010 by joining the Thermodynamics Laboratory of the University of Li√®ge in Belgium and taking part in different research projects: Bricker, iSERV, IEA EBC Annex 53.

Then, I joined the engineering consultancy firm Sweco Belgium where I had the opportunity to apply many energy efficiency concepts to projects dealing with energy audits, green building certifications (BREEAM), energy performance certifications (PEB Belgium) and HVAC system design.

Today, I'm looking for new challenges and developing new skills to take my career to the next level. I'm fully convinced that data science and machine learning can provide new and more efficient ways to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, as well as many other sectors.
