## Un poco acerca de mi

I’m a mechanical engineer with more than 10 years of experience in the field of the energy efficiency of buildings.

In 2010, I moved from Chile to Belgium to join the Thermodynamics Laboratory of the University of Liège as Research Engineer. Here I had the opportunity to actively participate in 3 interesting research projects related to energy in buildings: Bricker, iSERV and IEA EBC Annex 53.

Since 2018, I work as Expert for the engineering and architecture consultancy company Sweco Belgium where I deliver engineering and consulting services during the development and execution of energy efficiency projects in buildings.

In the last time I have developed an intense curiosity in data science, machine learning and deep learning applications.
